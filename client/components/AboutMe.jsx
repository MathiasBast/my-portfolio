      <p>My name is Mathias Sebastian Peter Bast</p>
      <p>
        I was born on March 10th, 2002 in West Auckland in a town called Laingholm. I did stay in Auckland until late 2017. Then I did move to
        Gisborne on the East Coast where I did finish college and further my interest in technology. I did get recommended a code Bootcamp named
        Enspiral Dev Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did move back to Auckland to attend Enspiral Dev Academy and graduated. At EDA I there was an emphasis on self-teaching so I can further
        my career by myself and teach my self new skills which are crucial to this industry because it is constantly evolving.
