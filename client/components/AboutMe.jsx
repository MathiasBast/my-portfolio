      <p>
        I was born on March 10th, 2002 in West Auckland in a town called Laingholm. I did stay in Auckland until late 2017. Then I did move to
        Gisborne on the East Coast where I did finish college and further my interest in technology. I did get recommended a code Bootcamp named
        Enspiral Dev Academy.
