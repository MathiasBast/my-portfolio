          I do love coding and learning new things, I think I love it because of the satisfaction of putting it to use at the end, 
          and once I understand something I do have an urge to try to understand how it works. I think this does make me a good learner 
          who can pick things up easily who is easily motivated to work projects to completion.

          I attended EDA (Enspiral Dev Academy) which is a boot camp. I went to the Auckland campus but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I did
          complete most of it online. In the last weeks of EDA, we did have simulations of work environments with agile practices and scrum roles,
          and a very high code quality. EDA did emphasize testing with Jest and I did learn about Enzyme along the way. From the boot camp, I did
          learn a lot about working remotely effectively and how to teach myself skills, I think this is very valuable in a modern work environment.
          To work remotely I do need to be motivated, this can be by the work I am doing or a team around me. EDA did also teaches about people
          skills, like empathy, feedback, conflict resolution, and more. These may sound simple but they taught how to implement them in a work
          environment while keeping a team working together productively and I have used them in my personal life a few times because of how
          useful I find them.
