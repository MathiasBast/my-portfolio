        <p>Hello, my name us Mathias</p>
        <p>
          I do love coding and learning new things, I think I love it because of the satisfaction of putting it to use at the end,
          and once I understand something I do have an urge to try to understand how it works. I think this does make me a good learner
          who can pick things up easily who is easily motivated to work projects to completion.

          I attended EDA (Enspiral Dev Academy) which is a boot camp. I went to the Auckland campus but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I did
          complete most of it online. In the last weeks of EDA, we did have simulations of work environments with agile practices and scrum roles,
          and a very high code quality. EDA did emphasize testing with Jest and I did learn about Enzyme along the way. From the boot camp, I did
          learn a lot about working remotely effectively and how to teach myself skills, I think this is very valuable in a modern work environment.
          To work remotely I do need to be motivated, this can be by the work I am doing or a team around me. EDA did also teaches about people
          skills, like empathy, feedback, conflict resolution, and more. These may sound simple but they taught how to implement them in a work
          environment while keeping a team working together productively and I have used them in my personal life a few times because of how
          useful I find them.

          I do love going on walks and runs. I did spend a few years in Gisborne on the east coast which has amazing beaches to run or walk on
          with amazing sun rises and sets over the sea which does light up the sky with the most beautiful orange glow. I do also love tramping,
          which I don't do as much as I would like to. My favorite place to tramp is at lake waikaremoana. It is a lake in the north island of
          New Zealand, it is a few days walk and with amazing views that make the whole this worth is.

          I do also love swimming, surfing, and everything to do with the sea. I have grown up around water, as a kid, I was at Piha on the
          West Coast of Auckland where I did find my love for the sea. I did spend a lot of time playing in the waves and became good at swimming.
          I think this did shape the person I am now. I am not as good at surfing as I would like to be so I am going to try to put some time towards
          learning how to surf and becoming good at it, which will just come with practice.
